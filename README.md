## Card Store for Full Auto Store

* This card store is leaving the code open source for anyone else to use, should you want to start a store of your own.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the build, how to set it up on your own, or contributions you may want to make to improve the quality of the store. 

## Build Instructions

This store is built with the MERN stack.  You will need to have the following installed: 

* Node
* Homebrew -> Makes setup easier for node
* MongoDB and Atlas -> For the purposes of this code base, my database will not be connected to this, however there will be comments in the code regarding how to set it up on your own.  
* React
* All scripts were run using Yarn

## Use

Please be respectful when using this code, as I use this website for my own use day to day.  Do not exploit the transparency I'm providing, including attempting to sabotage or inhibit its use by any customers I may have.
